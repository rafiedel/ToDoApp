## What I've Learned:

From the process of making this app, I gained valuable knowledge on how to create Flutter applications like widgets, state management, integrating data from local storage, and a time-based job scheduler. Not only that, I also learned about other software engineering principles. Throughout my exploration, I encountered various challenges, but those challenges became valuable sources of knowledge to level up my skills. For instance, when determining and displaying DateTime data in an AlertDialog or ShowModal Bottom Sheet, if I only used regular setState, the data wouldn't update, and it would still display the previous date. Therefore, Flutter provides state managers like Provider and Bloc to address such issues.

All of that I obtained through my exploration via PubDev, Stack Overflow, GitHub Discussions, YouTube, and various other websites. What I've learned from this is to create as many projects as possible and as often as possible, look up references by browsing, and don't be afraid to try new things. Because of going through those experiences, I went from simply following other people's code and work to understanding the basics of creating a feature and being able to write the code myself. Of course, my learning doesn't stop there. I want to dive deeper and advance further into mobile development.
